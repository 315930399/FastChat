It is seen as a method of data analysis, automating analytical model building. Machine learning allows computers to find hidden insights without being explicitly programmed where to look.\n\n1. **Supervised Learning**: This is the most common technique. Here, the model is trained on a labelled dataset. A labelled dataset is one where the target or outcome variable is known. For instance, in a dataset about customers, we may know the age, gender, income, and whether they made a purchase or not. The model would learn the patterns that lead to a purchase. Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the outcome (whether a new customer will make a purchase or not) based on the features (age, gender, income). A real-world example of supervised learning is email filtering - the algorithm learns to filter out spam mail based on past data of spam and non-spam emails.\n\n2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Unlike supervised learning, the model here is trained on an unlabeled dataset. That is, the outcome variable is not known. The goal in this type of learning is to model the underlying structure or distribution in the data to learn more about the data. Unsupervised learning techniques are used for clustering, dimensionality reduction, etc. A real-world example of unsupervised learning is customer segmentation in the marketing industry. Here, the algorithm identifies certain clusters based on buying behavior, demographics, etc., which the business can target with custom strategies.\n\n3. **Reinforcement Learning**: In this type of learning, an agent learns to behave in an environment, by performing certain actions and observing the rewards/results which it gets from those actions. It's about taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation. It is employed by various software and machines to find the best possible behavior or path it should take in a specific context. A real-world example of reinforcement learning is learning to play a game against an opponent. The system makes a move, the opponent responds, and the system adjusts its strategy based on whether it is winning or losing.\n\nIn summary, supervised learning uses labeled data to predict a label given certain features, unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in input data, and reinforcement learning learns from the environment by interacting with it and receiving rewards for performing actions."]}], "tstamp": 1697791947.0269074}

Therefore, to find the probability of getting heads 10 times in a row, you simply multiply the probability of getting a head in one toss by itself 10 times.\n\nSo, the probability of getting 10 heads in a row is 0.7^10 = 0.0282475249, or about 0.028."]}], "tstamp": 1697791916.3974838}

Here's a step-by-step plan for a weekend road trip from Berkeley, CA.\n\n**Step 1: Decide on Your Destination**\nBased on your preferences, I would recommend you to visit Yosemite National Park. It's approximately a 3.5-hour drive from Berkeley and offers breathtaking landscapes, scenic drives, and plenty of opportunities for sightseeing. \n\n**Step 2: Plan Your Route**\nYou can take the CA-120 E route to Yosemite. Along the way, you'll pass through Modesto where you can stop for a meal or a quick break. Once you reach Yosemite, take the Tioga Pass road for a scenic drive through the park. \n\n**Step 3: Plan Your Activities**\nYosemite National Park offers a variety of activities. You can explore Yosemite Valley, hike to Mariposa Grove to see the giant sequoias, or trek up to Glacier Point for a stunning view of Half Dome. \n\n**Step 4: Accommodation**\nConsider staying overnight in the park for the full experience. There are several options available, from campsites to lodges. You should book your accommodation in advance as they can fill up quickly.\n\n**Step 5: Pack Accordingly**\nMake sure you pack the essentials for your trip. This includes comfortable hiking shoes, warm clothing for the evening, plenty of water, snacks, a map of the park, and a camera to capture the beautiful scenery.\n\n**Step 6: Check Park Conditions**\nBefore you leave, check the park conditions on the Yosemite National Park website. This includes road closures, weather conditions, and any restrictions due to COVID-19.\n\n**Step 7: Departure**\nLeave Berkeley early in the morning to maximize your time at Yosemite. Make sure your vehicle is in good condition and that you have enough fuel for the trip.\n\nRemember to respect the park rules and leave no trace. Enjoy your weekend road trip!"]}], "tstamp": 1697791942.5985966}
